## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

**How prepared are the municipalities of Spain to receive us?**

Ã‰xodus is aimed to two main points: the first one, to guide our society in these term by providing us with a national scoring that reveals the potential of certain parts of our country that we may thought were inhospitable as well as to show up which areas may need some improvements in terms of the most important public facilities, connectivity or cultural offers. The second one is to raise awareness of how feasible it is to move to smaller cities or villages as a lot of them are completely livable. We pretend to help our country to work towards a more uniform population density throughout the different autonomous communities. This is a project created by people for people.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- Dataframe creation (we have used different methodologies to create a solid and representative database)
- PCA
- Clustering

## ðŸ”¦ Examples
- An example of data cleaning is limpieza_guardia_civil.ipynb
- An example of scraping is scrap_colegios.ipynb
- An example of fuction used is distancias_calculo.ipynb
- An example of master file is creacion_maestros.ipynb
- An example of union files is union_all_files.ipynb

Then, we have applied unsupervised methods:

- An example of PCA is create_pca.ipynb
- An example of kmeans is create_kmeans.ipynb
